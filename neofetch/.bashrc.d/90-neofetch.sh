# NOTE: Automatic neofetch gets quite annoying... I know on which system I am. So commenting this out for now.
# You can always run neofetch manually.

# Execute neofetch only if:
# - not inside TMUX and
# - if using an interactive shell (not if only running scripts or ssh commands)
# - if not inside VSCode

# if [ -z "$TMUX" ] && [ -n "$PS1" ] && [ "$TERM_PROGRAM" != "vscode" ]; then
#     neofetch
# fi
